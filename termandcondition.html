        <h3>dispute resolution</h3>
        <p class="p-3">ARBITRATION PROVISION AND JURY TRIAL AND CLASS ACTION WAIVERS PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT
            AFFECTS YOUR
            RIGHTS.
            YOU AGREE THAT BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITES, PARTICIPATING ON THE CHARM CHANNELS WITH CHARM, OR SIGNING
            UP
            FOR THE MOBILE PROGRAM, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
            ACTION.
            YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST CHARM ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
            CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION
            WILL
            TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.

            YOU AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
            THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOUR USE OF THE SITES, YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE MOBILE PROGRAM, OR YOUR
            DEALINGS
            WITH TARTE SHALL BE FINALLY SETTLED AND RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS
            SECTION.

            THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS INTENDED TO BE INTERPRETED BROADLY. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE
            COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES OF THE AMERICAN
            ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (AAA), AS MODIFIED BY THIS SECTION. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED USING ONE
            ARBITRATOR WITH SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING COMMERCIAL CONTRACT DISPUTES, WHO SHALL BE SELECTED FROM
            THE
            APPROPRIATE LIST OF ARBITRATORS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES OF ANY ARBITRATION
            ORGANIZATION OR ARBITRATOR THAT YOU AND TARTE AGREE UPON IN WRITING OR THAT IS APPOINTED PURSUANT TO SECTION
            5
            OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.

            FOR ANY CLAIM WHERE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE AWARD SOUGHT IS $10,000 OR LESS, THE ARBITRATOR, YOU AND TARTE
            MUST
            ABIDE BY THE FOLLOWING RULES: (A) THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY BASED ON TELEPHONE OR ONLINE
            APPEARANCES AND/OR WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS; AND (B) THE ARBITRATION SHALL NOT INVOLVE ANY PERSONAL APPEARANCE BY
            THE
            PARTIES OR WITNESSES UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES. IF THE CLAIM EXCEEDS $10,000, THE
            RIGHT TO
            A HEARING WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE AAA RULES, AND THE HEARING (IF ANY) MUST TAKE PLACE IN NEW YORK, NEW
            YORK.
            THE ARBITRATOR’S RULING IS BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION,
            OR
            APPLICATION MAY BE MADE TO SUCH COURT FOR JUDICIAL ACCEPTANCE OF ANY AWARD AND AN ORDER OF ENFORCEMENT, AS
            THE
            CASE MAY BE.

            THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES
            APPLICABLE IN COURT AND REVIEW BY A COURT IS LIMITED.

            YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE A COURT OR JURY TRIAL OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.
            YOU
            UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY AGREEING TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, YOU ARE WAIVING
            THE
            RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL. ANY DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS
            ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
            CONSOLIDATE
            THE CLAIMS OF MULTIPLE PARTIES.

            ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS AND
            CONDITIONS,
            YOUR USE OF THE SITES, YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE MOBILE PROGRAM, OR YOUR DEALINGS WITH TARTE MUST BE
            COMMENCED
            IN ARBITRATION WITHIN TWO (2) YEARS AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. AFTER THAT TWO (2)-YEAR PERIOD, SUCH
            CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW TIME LIMITATIONS OTHER THAN
            THOSE SET FORTH IN SUCH STATE’S STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS LAWS. IN SUCH CASES, THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF
            LIMITATIONS PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE LAWS OF SUCH STATE SHALL APPLY.

            YOU AGREE THAT ALL CHALLENGES TO THE VALIDITY AND APPLICABILITY OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION—I.E. WHETHER A
            PARTICULAR CLAIM OR DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION—SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR. NOTWITHSTANDING
            ANY
            PROVISION IN THESE TERMS TO THE CONTRARY, IF THE CLASS-ACTION WAIVER ABOVE IS DEEMED INVALID OR
            UNENFORCEABLE,
            YOU AGREE THAT YOU SHALL NOT SEEK TO, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO, ARBITRATE CLASS OR COLLECTIVE CLAIMS. IF THE
            ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS SECTION IS FOUND UNENFORCEABLE OR TO NOT APPLY FOR A GIVEN DISPUTE, THEN THE
            PROCEEDING MUST BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN THE STATE COURTS OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION OR THE UNITED STATES
            DISTRICT COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK, AS APPROPRIATE, AND YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE PERSONAL
            JURISDICTION OF EACH OF THESE COURTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF LITIGATING SUCH CLAIMS OR DISPUTES, AND YOU STILL
            WAIVE
            YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PROCEED IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION, AND
            REMAIN
            BOUND BY ANY AND ALL LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND DAMAGES INCLUDED IN THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THIS
            ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WILL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF YOUR USE OF THE SITES OR TARTE
            CHANNELS, YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE MOBILE PROGRAM, AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH TARTE. THIS ARBITRATION
            AGREEMENT
            INVOLVES INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND, THEREFORE, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. §§
            1-16
            (FAA), AND NOT BY STATE LAW. INFORMATION ON AAA AND HOW TO START ARBITRATION CAN BE FOUND AT WWW.ADR.ORG. IF
            YOU
            WISH TO INITIATE ARBITRATION AGAINST CHARM, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO TARTE AT </p>
